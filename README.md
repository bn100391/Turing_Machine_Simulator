# Turing_Machine_Simulator

## What This Is: 🗣️  

A Turing machine is a simple model of a computer. It has:
- Tape: Like an endless strip of paper where you can write symbols (like 0s and 1s).
- Head: A part that reads and writes on the tape, and can move left or right.
- States: Different conditions or modes it can be in while working.
- Rules: Instructions for what to do based on what the head sees (like writing a symbol or moving the head).
It’s a way of understanding how computers solve problems by following simple steps, and it shows what can and can’t be computed.

These were very large, mechanical machines. 

This repository contains software that simulates what these machines used to do, with the aim of gaining a greater understanding of what the computer is fundamentally.

##  🛠️ What I Did:  

Key features of the implementation:   
➤ **Parse input files for turing machine specification**  
➤ **Decide on and impliment the appropriate data structures to model the turing machine**   
➤ **Impliment the algorithm for carrying out the simulation itself**
